    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the homepage of my first website! From here, you will be able to navigate around the website. All of this
        is a work in progress. Please take a look around!

    <p>
        I have learned some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on CodeAcademy, but I've never really applied it to my own website.
        I am following <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a> as I do this.

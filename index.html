    <h1>Homepage</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the homepage of my first website! From here, you will be able to navigate around the website. All of this
        is a work in progress. Please take a look around!
    </p>

        I have learned some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on CodeAcademy, but I've never really applied it to my own website.
        I am following <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Odin Project</a> as I do this.

        To implement my first webpage, I am going to compile some recipies that I would like to use this summer. I've always struggled to come up with
        new and creative food ideas that aren't just pasta, so this will be lots of fun to be able to rely on!
    </p>

    <h2>Recipies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./recipies/Creamy_Ramen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rich and Creamy Ramen</a></li>
    </ul>

# my_first_website

Welcome to my first website!

Now that I've taken some more advanced model-based programming and advanced algorithms classes, I want to be able to apply my skills to some personal project this summer!

To start, I'm following The Odin Project to get some background on web development, to get some more context on how things work in the software world. 

I am making the website in this repository as I learn the inner workings of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
